I used the following links to solve this challenge:

- Making HTTP Request without third party libraries
    - I use this article to create a GET request for the articles
    - https://mobikul.com/android-create-http-request-without-library/

- Allow the app to open unsafe urls
    - Links to the articles are not encrypted so android prevents opening the URL
    - Adding this to the manifest might cause security issues
